# input gets the value from a user and saves it as a String
name = input("Please enter your name: ")

# String must be converted to a number (integer) to be used for calculations
age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))

# Test
print("Hello", name, "you are", age, "next year you will be", age + 1)

# len identifies the amount of characters the variable has, for e.g. name
print("Your name has", len(name), "letters")
